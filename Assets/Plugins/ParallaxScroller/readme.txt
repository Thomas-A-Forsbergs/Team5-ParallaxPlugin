Install
--------
Import the plugin in an Unity project.


Setup
-------
Make sure you have a camera with the tag MainCamera.
Make sure the input system has "horizontal" and "vertical" axis defined.


Usage
-------
Open the DemoScene to try the functionality. Control the player with WASD or arrow keys.

To start with your own background sprites, open the EmptyScene, and start adding sprites using the Background object's inspector.


Recomendations
---------------

For better performance don't use a too large ortoghraphic view.


Compatability
--------------

This plugin doesn't support collisions. If this is required, you must add your own ground collider, separate from the ground parallax object.

This plugin doesn't support zoom features.

Install
--------
Import the plugin in a Unity project. 

Setup
-------
Make sure you have a camera with the tag MainCamera.
Make sure the input system has "horizontal" and "vertical" axis defined.

Usage
-------
Open the DemoScene to try the functionality. Control the player with wasd or arrows.

To start with your own background sprites, open the EmptyScene, and start adding sprites using the Background object's inspector.

This plugin does not support collisions with ground. If this is required, you must add your own ground collider, separate from the ground parallax object.
